# PreProcessing-Text-EgyptAir
A Desktop program for EgyptAir company, the purpose of this program to extract data from a huge text messages that include the details of fly trips.

  
## Purpose of this program:
Convert the process that takes long time of reading text messages to an automated process of extracting the diserd data and filling an excel sheet with this data.

## Technologies used:
I used python with the tkinter framework to build the GUI of the desktop application, other built-in functions and standard libraries for processing the data and writing it to an excel sheet.

## Convert python code to a program(Extension .exe):
  - Install PyInstaller using pip: Open a command prompt or terminal window and type "pip install pyinstaller".
    -  ``` 
       pip install pyinstaller
       ```
  - Open a command prompt or terminal window: Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.

  - Use PyInstaller to create the executable: Type "pyinstaller scriptname.py"  in the command prompt or terminal window, where "test_tkinter.py" (in this case) is the name of your Python script.
    -   ```
         pyinstaller test_tkinter.py
        ``` 

  - Locate the executable file: PyInstaller will create a "dist" folder in the same directory as your Python script. Inside the "dist" folder, you will find the    executable file.


Note : to run and test this program the text must be in the required format of Egyptair
